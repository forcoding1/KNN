# K-Nearest Neighbours

predicted whether a woman has a breast cancer or not based few parameters. The last column there which is type
of cancer actually means type of cell 2 means cancer causing and 4 means not cancer causing.
And made a custom version of k Nearest Neighbours using numpy which is similar to the one in sklearn library.
